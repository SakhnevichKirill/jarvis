# Jarvis

This project connects OS-Copilot and a typical audio assistant to enable advanced voice recognition and dialogue management.

## Overview

Jarvis is designed to:
- Recognize wake words using pvporcupine
- Convert speech to text using Whisper
- Manage interactive dialogues using OS-Copilot
- Convert text responses back into speech using TTS

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Detects wake words and transcribes spoken commands.
- **Voice Generation**: Converts textual responses into synthesized speech.
- **Dialogue Management**: Uses OS-Copilot for planning and executing tasks based on user commands.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A local installation of [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to setup the project:

1. Clone the main Jarvis repository:
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SakhnevichKirill/Jarvis.git
   cd Jarvis
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r os_copilot/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file inside the `OS-Copilot` directory from the provided template.
   - Refer to the [OS-Copilot documentation](https://github.com/OS-Copilot) for specific configuration details.

## Usage

To start the Jarvis assistant, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
python main.py
```
